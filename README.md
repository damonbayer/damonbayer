## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistician and infectious disease researcher based in Saint Paul, MN.
I currently work as a data scientist within the [CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html).
There, I am responsible for developing open-source tools for short-term forecasting of disease outbreaks.

Prior to joining the CDC, I obtained a [PhD in statistics at UC Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu), where I was advised by [Volodymyr Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/index.html).
My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2854278776) focused on inference and forecasting using infectious disease surveillance data.
Before beginning graduate school in California, I completed my undergraduate and master's education in [mathematics and statistics](https://www.sdstate.edu/mathematics-and-statistics) at [South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).

My previous employment history includes a variety of positions at other government and government-adjacent agencies, including [The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/biostatistics-research-branch) and [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org).
I have lived with Type 1 Diabetes since childhood and applied my data science expertise in this domain at [Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org) and [Glooko](https://glooko.com).
